## About Me  
I‚Äôm a theoretical physicist interested in vacuum instability and polarization effects in intense electromagnetic fields.  
My research also explores classical, semiclassical, and quantum theories of electromagnetic radiation in external backgrounds.  
I‚Äôm fascinated by the power of asymptotic analysis in mathematical physics, and I enjoy bringing these ideas into both research and teaching.
