## ðŸ‘‹ About Me  
Iâ€™m a theoretical physicist interested in vacuum instability and polarization effects in intense electromagnetic fields.  
My research also explores classical, semiclassical, and quantum theories of electromagnetic radiation in external backgrounds.  
Iâ€™m fascinated by the elegance of asymptotic analysis in mathematical physics, and I enjoy bringing these ideas into both research and teaching.
